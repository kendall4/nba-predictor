"""
Step 1: Build Training Dataset
===============================
This script creates training data by:
1. Loading historical games (2024-25, 2025-26)
2. For each game, matching player features with ACTUAL outcomes
3. The "target" is what the player ACTUALLY scored in that game
4. The "features" are: season averages, opponent defense, pace, etc.

This teaches the model: "Given these conditions, player X scored Y"
