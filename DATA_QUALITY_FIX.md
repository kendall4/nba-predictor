# Data Quality Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

The inflated predictions were caused by:

1. **WNBA teams in data**: The NBA API was returning WNBA teams (Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, etc.) mixed with NBA teams
2. **Early season data quality**: Teams with < 15 games had unreliable stats (e.g., Boston Celtics GP=10 had DEF_RATING=330.3 instead of ~110)
3. **No data validation**: Bad data was being used directly in predictions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Data Collection (`src/data_collection/nba_stats.py`)
- ✅ Filter out WNBA teams by TEAM_ID (NBA: 1610612737-1610612766)
- ✅ Filter by team name keywords to catch missed teams
- ✅ Filter out teams with < 15 games (unreliable early-season data)
- ✅ Validate and flag outlier stats (DEF_RATING, OFF_RATING, PACE)

### 2. Prediction Logic (`src/features/matchup_features.py`)
- ✅ Cap DEF_RATING to 80-130 range (use 112.0 default if out of range)
- ✅ Cap OFF_RATING to max 130
- ✅ Validate PACE values (90-105 range)

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Cache MatchupFeatureBuilder instance (avoids reloading data)
- ✅ Pre-filter players to only today's games (faster iteration)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly sidebar (collapsible)

## Action Required

**Re-run data collection to get clean data:**

```bash
python src/data_collection/nba_stats.py
```

This will:
- Filter out WNBA teams
- Remove teams with < 15 games
- Generate warnings for outliers
- Save clean data to `data/raw/team_pace_2025-26.csv`

**Then regenerate predictions in the Streamlit app.**

## Mobile Optimization

Streamlit works on mobile browsers. Optimizations:
- ✅ Collapsible sidebar
- ✅ Responsive layout (wide mode)
- ✅ Touch-friendly UI components

For better mobile experience:
- Tables auto-adjust width
- Sidebar can be collapsed
- All tabs are accessible

## Performance Improvements

1. **Cached builder instance**: Data only loaded once per session
2. **Pre-filtered player lists**: Only processes players in today's games
3. **Session state caching**: Predictions cached in Streamlit session

Future optimizations possible:
- Parallel processing for player features (using multiprocessing)
- Background job for pre-generating predictions
- Database caching for frequently accessed data
